Its impressive bird-like wingspan and elusive nature have made it a favorite among butterfly aficionados. But truth be told, the so-called great purple emperor has some not-so-great personal peculiarities. For one...it has two horrid HORNS upon its head when it is in its caterpillar form. For two...it has been known to dine on feces and animal carcasses! Hoo! That's why I call it the Emperor of EWWW!"
