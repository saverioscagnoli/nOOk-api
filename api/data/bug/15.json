While most moths are nocturnal, this one flutters about during the day, making good use of the light. That is, when the daylight reflects off its wings, a kaleidoscope of colors are revealed! Oh! Eh...too bad it has such startling red feet as a caterpillar. I might have found it almost tolerable otherwise. Almost, but not quite."
