Surely you've seen what a menace they make of themselves at picnics. 'Tis hardly the worst of it, wot wot! Aggressive predators with venomous stingers, wasps not only hunt and eat other insects... they paralyze their prey, then drag their victims home ALIVE, leaving them for their larva to feed upon. Suddenly a simple sting seems quite tolerable."
