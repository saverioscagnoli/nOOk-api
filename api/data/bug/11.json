The males gather in groups to sip the moisture while the females hide in jungle trees. And though they dress to impress in red and green, these fluttering fiends are not just stylish... They're also quite malicious! Their little larvae pack a poisonous punch that's supposed to protect them from predators... But I suspect more diabolical designs."
