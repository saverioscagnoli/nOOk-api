What I do NOT find pleasant is the way these things rub their strange wings together to make their song! Ick and blech! And to make matters worse, bell crickets have been known to shed two of their four wings! And they simply leave these wings where they fall, as if it were litter! I simply cannot abide such odious behavior."
