  "blathers": "The giant snakehead is quite a sight to behold, wot! One glance conjurs up visions of its namesake. This resilient creature can even find a home in the mud, where it is able to breathe. As a matter of fact, it dislikes cold weather, so during wintertime the mud serves as its temporary home. I hear that they eat anything that swims past their head. While odd, I feel a sense of owlship with them.",
