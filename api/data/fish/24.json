  "blathers": "The pike has always reminded me a bit of salmon, although a pike can grow rather larger. These brutes can grow to over four feet long, sometimes MUCH over! Hoo hoo! It is carnivorous and preys not only on other fish, but also mammals and some waterfowl. If I were to ever meet one in the water, I would have a most difficult time keeping my wits about me.",
