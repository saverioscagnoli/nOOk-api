And though five-armed sea stars are the most common, there are species with 20 or even 40 arms out there! Ah, but the fascinating appendage fats do not end there, wot wot! You see upon each sea star's arm sprout many dozens of tiny feet. YES, FEET! They use these suction-cupped feet not just to move about...but to...eh... grab hold of dinner guests as well. Finally, it should be noted that when a sea star loses an arm, it can grow it back. More impressive yes, a served sea star arm...can sometimes grow an entire sea star body back!"
