However, unlike its relatives, it has no shell nor spikes to with which to protect itself either. So how does a softy such as this stay safe in the open ocean? Brace yourself I say… when threatened sea cucumbers jettison their innards out of their backsides! Hoo! Gross but true! The sticky, stringy stuff ensnares predators, allowing the cuke to make its escape and grow its insides back. One might say…the sea cucumber is a GUTSY creature, indeed. Hoo hoo, hee hee! Do forgive me!"
