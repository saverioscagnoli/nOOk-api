Sea pigs are, in fact, a type of sea cucumber that lives deep down on the ocean floor. About four inches long, these soft pinkish oddities use tube-like legs and feelers to get around. Thus they snuffle through the mud, slurping up particles from decaying carcasses. Meanwhile, predators be warned... This little piggy tastes like poison."
