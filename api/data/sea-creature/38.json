These silly things are known for popping their heads out of the sand to nibble on plankton drifting by. Some say this makes them look like plants sprouting in a garden...hence the name spotted garden eel. But I think they look more like prairie dogs peeking out of desert hidey-holes. \"Prairie eels\" has a lovely ring, don't you think?"
