Mussels have a special gland that secretes a thing called \"bysuss\" or \"byssal thread.\" They use these tough beard-like fibers to anchor themselves to rocks and keep themselves in place. So, you see, the mussel's beard is functional rather than merely stylish. Then again, perhaps all beards should be this way."
