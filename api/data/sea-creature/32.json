    "blathers": "Think carefully before you mock the mantis shrimp for its diminutive size. I warn you, it's itching for a fight! A pugilist through and through, this brightly hued fellow packs a punch unparalleled on land or sea. Not only are its forelimbs shaped like clubs and scythes, its arms are naturally spring-loaded too! Thus the mantis shrimp's high-speed blows crack open crabs and oyster shells with ease. And should you grab it with your hands, you might discover why it's called \"the thumb splitter\" too!"
