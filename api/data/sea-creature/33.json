And what a clever crustacean it is, having found a way to use those antennae as a means of defense. When the spiny lobster senses danger, it rubs its antennae across its exoskeleton. The horrid screeching sound frightens predators away! If someone scratched nails across a chalkboard in your direction, I daresay you'd run too!"
