You see, the octopus has specialized skin cells that can change color and texture with lightening speed. Thus it can look for all the world like a patch of seabed one minute...and a pile of rocks the next! But the deception doesn't stop there, wot wot. When attacked by a predator, the octopus releases a cloud of ink and -POOF- makes its escape. Let's just call the octopus what it is, shall we? The ninja of the deep!"
