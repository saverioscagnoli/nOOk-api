These deep-sea octopuses are on the smallish side and use the cutest ear-like fins to flutter about. Meanwhile, it's the web stretched between their tentacles that gives them their name. Hoo, it's true! With arms stretched wide, they look for all the world like an umbrella! Though surely the last thing the umbrella octopus wants...is to stay dry."
