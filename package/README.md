# [nOOk API](https://nook-api.vercel.app)

## Animal Crossing New Horizons database, accessible to anyone! üçÉ

Hello! I made this api as a little side project and I hope it can help anyone who wants to use it.
It's a free api containing various information about **Animal Crossing New Horizons.** ü¶ù

To start using it, just run `npm install nook-api`. 
[Here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nook-api) is the NPM official page.

#### This database contains infos and sprites of:

- Fishes and sea creatures üé£
- Bugs ü¶ã
- Art pieces üé®
- K.K. songs üê∂üéµ (gotta love bubblegum)
- Hourly songs üïõüéµ
- Villagers ü¶Ü

To get started, this package is made by different **clients**, each one for a different seed:

- [x] FishClient() > fishes
- [x] BugClient() > bugs
- [x] SeaCreatureClient() > sea creatures
- [ ] ArtClient() > art pieces
- [ ] SongClient() > songs
- [ ] VillagerClient() > villagers

Each one has its own function to find the data you need! Example (JavaScript):

```javascript
import { FishingClient } from "nook-api";
const client = new FishClient();

console.log(await client.renderById(45));
```

Which outputs:

![shark](https://nook-api.vercel.app/api/render/fish/74)

Or you can make a request to the api url!
Example:

```javascript
import { fetch } from "undici";

let req = await fetch("https://nook-api.vercel.app/api/data/fish/74");
let data = await req.json();
console.log(data);
```
